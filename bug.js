This error occurs when you try to access a state variable in a component before it has been initialized. This is often the case in functional components where you use the useState hook. 
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> {/* This will be undefined before the component mounts*/}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
